There were several bugs for MP3.1. 

IDT:
- We found it very difficult to do correct c/asm mapping. It took us a long time to figure out how to do the proper include statements, and figure out the logic behind using set_entry with asm functions as compared to c functions. 
    - time to fix: 3 hours

Paging: 

PIC: 
- ports listed on OSDevwiki did not map correctly to our system. We got it to work using a combination of OSDevWiki and the Intel docs
    - time to fix: 2 hours
- we were only getting one interrupt per boot, demonstrated by the keyboard typing only one character. To fix, we found via GDB that the issue was in our     send_eoi(). After changing the logic of our send_eoi we recieved the correct behavior. 
    - time to fix: 1 hours

Keyboard: 
- Once the pic worked properly, there few bugs in getting the keyboard input and mapping it to characters. It is well described in OSDevWiki.  

RTC: 
- Similar to the keyboard, RTC worked simply when the PIC was working properly.
